// Swift Study
// Different between Class and Struct

// Build class & struct

class Car{
    var color: String
    init(color:String){
        self.color = color
    }
}

struct Bike{
    var color: String
    init(color: String){
        self.color = color
    }
}



// class is ref

var myCar = Car(color: "RED")
print("Color of my car is \(myCar.color)")

var sellCar = myCar
sellCar.color = "BLUE"
print("Color of my car is \(myCar.color)")
print("Color of sell car is \(sellCar.color)")



// sturck is value

var myBike = Bike(color: "SILVER")
print("Color of my bike is \(myBike.color)")

var cloneBike = myBike
cloneBike.color = "BLACK"
print("Color of my bike is \(myBike.color)")
print("Color of clone bike is \(cloneBike.color)")
